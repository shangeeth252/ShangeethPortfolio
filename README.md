# Data Analysis Portfolio
My name is Shangeeth Uthayakumar and I am a graduate of Mcmaster University with a degree in Commerce. I have studied various topics of finance in particular and wish to use my knowledge in data analysis in this field. To show some my efforts towards learning skills in data analysis, I have added some completed certifcates. All these certificates are associates with my goals in data analytics.

I have added various data science projects which showcases some of my skills. Have a look at some data sets I have analyzed to make the data make more sense to to the average viewer. My focus is to make data easier to understand for businesses and individuals who want to make well informed decisions. So far, I have two projects that go in depth with data analysis in topics such as [Suicide](https://github.com/shangeeth252/ShangeethUPortfolio/blob/master/Suicide%20analysis.ipynb) and [Gun Violence](https://github.com/shangeeth252/ShangeethUPortfolio/blob/master/Gun%20Violence%20Analysis.ipynb). I wish to add more projects that involve data cleaning and machine learning in relation to finance.
